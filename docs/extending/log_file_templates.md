# Log File Templates

Log file templates provide the definitions that are used by the `make_note` command.  Currently they are implemented to
be used only as front matter definitions of the markdown files.

## Template Methods

The templates are implemented as a `name` and two methods, `start` and `end`.  A named tuple has been defined in
`autology.reports.models.Template`.  The two methods must be stateless as they can be called at any time.  

```python
import frontmatter


def start():
    """Return a newly created frontmatter post object that can be written out to a file"""
    return frontmatter.Post('', meta='data', definition={})
  
  
def end(post):
    """Modify the content of the post object provided."""
    post.metadata['some_key'] = False

    return post
``` 

## Registration

Templates are registered into the system using python entry points.  Specifically the group `autology_templates`.  The
method registered here must return a `Template` object or a list of templates.

```python
from autology.reports.models import Template

def register_template():
  return Template(name='dummy_template', start, end)
```
