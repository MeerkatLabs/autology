# Timeline Plugin

This is a plugin that will process all of the markdown files that are provided to it and build a 
collection of reports organized by date and time.  

## Generated Reports

### Main Report

Contains a list of all the dates that have logs associated with them.

### Daily Report 

Contains the contents of the logs concatenated together into a large HTML file.

## Configuration Values

N/A

## TODO

- Need to figure out how this content is going to be organized in the future
- Provide a report that will show the number of logs that have been generated for the calendar
  similar to how github displays the activity of a given user
