# Project Report

This plugin will provide a collection of all of the projects that have been registered with the 
application.  This is done through frontmatter details in each of the markdown files or via YAML
definition files that are also included in the log directories.

Each post can then be tagged with a report identifier that will be used to collate logs with the
projects that they are about, as well as track the amount of time that is spent on each of the 
projects.

## Generated Reports

### Main Report

Lists all of the organizations and the associated projects.  

### Individual Project Report

Lists all of the logs associated with the report as well as the current state of the project. This
is done by collecting all of the values stored in the frontmatter.  It can also list the customers
of each project and the POC information.
